\usage{
MK_RMCentrality(
  nodes,
  distance = list(type = "centroid"),
  distance_thresholds = NULL,
  binary = TRUE,
  probability = NULL,
  rasterparallel = FALSE,
  write = NULL,
  intern = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{Object of class sf, SpatialPolygonsDataFrame or raster.
It must be in a projected coordinate system. If nodes is a raster layer then raster values (Integer) will be taken as "id".}

\item{distance}{list. Distance parameters. For example: type, resistance,or keep. For "type" choose one
of the distances: "centroid" (faster), "edge",
"least-cost" or "commute-time". If the type is equal to "least-cost" or "commute-time", then you have
to use the "resistance" argument. To see more arguments see the ?distancefile.}

\item{distance_thresholds}{numeric. Distance or distances thresholds to establish connections (in meters). For example, one distance: distance_threshold = 30000; two or more specific distances:
distance_thresholds = c(30000, 50000); sequence distances: distance_thresholds = seq(10000,100000, 10000).}

\item{binary}{logical. Binary metrics, it only considers the distance thresholds to establish if a pair of nodes is (1) or not connected (0). Probability argument is not necessary.}

\item{probability}{numeric. Connection probability to the selected distance threshold, e.g., 0.5 that is 50 percentage of probability connection. Use in case of selecting the "PC" metric.
If probability = NULL, then it will be the inverse of the mean dispersal distance for the species (1/α; Hanski and Ovaskainen 2000).}

\item{rasterparallel}{logical. If nodes is "raster" then you can use this argument to assign the metrics values to the nodes raster. It is useful when raster resolution is less than 100 m2.}

\item{write}{character. Write output shapefile. It is necessary to specify the "Folder direction"
+ "Initial prefix",  for example, "C:/ejemplo".}

\item{intern}{logical. Show the progress of the process, default = TRUE. Sometimes the advance process does not reach 100 percent when operations are carried out very quickly.}

\description{
Use this function to calculate centrality measures. under one or several distance thresholds.
}
\details{
This function implements Patch-Scale Connectivity or Centrality Measures. Radial measures: degree, strength (using probability argument, for weighted graphs),
eigenvector centrality (eigen), and closeness centrality (close). Medial measures: betweenness centrality (BWC),
node memberships (cluster), and modularity (modules, using probability argument).
The function builds on functions out of Csardi’s ’igraph’ package.
